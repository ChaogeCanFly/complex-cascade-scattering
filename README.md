# Complex cascade acoustics

This repository contains the codes used to produce the results in the paper
["Acoustic scattering by cascades with complex boundary conditions: compliance, porosity and impedance"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09015).

The paper is concerned with calculating the scattering by an acoustic or vortical wave interacting with a cascade of blades with complex boundary conditions. The boundary conditions
can model a range of physical phenomena, including compliance, porosity, and impedance. We derive exact solutions using the Wiener--Hopf method.
Equipped with these solutions, it is now straightforward to calculate important aeroacoustic quantities, as illustrated below:

Note the vortex shedding in the chord-wise velocity field.

More details to follow soon.
